**Data Sources**:
The project is based on three primary datasets:

2. **Customer Data**: Contains customer demographic information such as gender, city, and date of birth.

3. **Product Category Info**: Holds the details of product categories and subcategories.

**Problem Statement**:
The e-commerce business is facing challenges related to understanding customer preferences, product performance, return rates, and the effectiveness of various sales channels. By analyzing the data, the business aims to answer the following questions:

-- What is the overall revenue generated across categories?
-- Which products have the highest sales and returns?
-- Which customer demographics contribute the most to sales?
-- What are the top-performing store types?
-- How are the transactions distributed across time periods?

This project answers these questions using SQL, allowing for better strategy formulation and business decisions.
